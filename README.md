# Payment-Processing
This project is an assignment for computer science course taken at UCSD. I have programmed for superclasses and subclasses that represent different payment methods (e.g. card, electronic). I further programmed for payment processing methods that mostly revolve around editing payment lists and comparing risk among two different payment methods.
